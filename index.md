## INTRODUCTION

This is an introductory workshop focusing on the fundamental concepts and skills needed to begin using **ArcGIS Pro** for exploring and analyzing spatial data.

#### GIS Resources at UBC:
- General Informational website for all things UBC GIS: [gis.ubc.ca](http://gis.ubc.ca/)    
- UBC Library's guide for finding and working with GIS resources: [guides.library.ubc.ca/gis](http://guides.library.ubc.ca/gis)
- UBC's GIS email list (participate or lurk!): [UBC GIS ListServ](https://lists.ubc.ca/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=GIS-LIST&A=1)  
- UBC's GIS Slack (create your own channel or lurk!): [ubcgis.slack.com](https://ubcgis.slack.com/)
- Evan Thornberry, GIS Librarian @ UBC Library: evan.thornberry AT ubc.ca

### Setup
This workshop requires the installation of Esri ArcGIS available from the [UBC Webstore](http://gis.ubc.ca/software/).
Students are eligible to download the ArcGIS suite for a fixed amount. As of 2019, this was $30/year.
For faculty and staff the annual license is more expensive. 

If you do not want to purchase a license, you can sign up for a [free 21-day trial](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/trial?rmedium=esri_com_redirects01&rsource=https://links.esri.com/pro/trial).

Make sure you have ArcGIS Desktop installed on your machine prior to the workshop.
If you need assistance, contact [UBC Geospatial Resources](http://gis.ubc.ca/connect/).

ArcGIS is also available on UBC Library's lab computers via VM's on a first-come-first-serve basis. Log in with your CWL to access remote labs here: [remote labs](https://remotelabs.ubc.ca).

Labs with ArcGIS:

Library Lab - Koerner Library Computer Lab (RM 217)
Library Lab - Data/GIS Lab (RM 218 A)
Library Lab - Digital Scholarship Lab (RM 497)

There will be three applications that come with your download of ArcGIS Desktop.

- **ArcCatalog**: file browser for managing and organizing your data
- **ArcMap**: program to view, edit, and analyze data and create maps
- **ArcGIS Pro**: newer program that has similar functionality to ArcMap but more 3D capability and better communication with ArcGIS Online

For the purposes of this workshop, we will only be using **ArcGIS Pro**.

#### Download Workshop Data
To get started with this workshop, you'll need to first download a [shapefile](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/shapefiles/what-is-a-shapefile.htm) of street tree data that we retrieved from the City of Vancouver [Open Data Portal.](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/pages/home/). 

Included in your download is a project folder containing the following files:
- Intro.**gdb**: the geodatabase with data for your map
- Intro.**aprx**: the project file with all the maps
- Intro.**tbx**: a toolbox with analytical tools for your project
- Index: folder with background organizing information

THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO DOWNLOAD WORKSHOP GDB CONTAINING LANGUAGE SPOKEN AT HOME DATA

Download [Data](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/download/?format=shp&timezone=America/Los_Angeles&lang=en){: .btn .btn-blue }
*1*{: .circle .circle-blue} Save this file (.**zip**) to your Desktop.
*2*{: .circle .circle-blue} Right-click on the .zip file you just downloaded and select **Extract All**...
*3*{: .circle .circle-blue} Accept all defaults to extract the file.    

## Need to add Pro project to download still and add shapefile to GitHub or somewhere else to download...
