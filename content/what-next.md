## What's Next?
We have just scratched the surface in terms of how you use visualization and analysis in GIS to better understand this language data. For example, another interesting analysis could be to use household income data to visualize the relationship between the distribution of languages spoken and household income. Are speakers of the different Chinese-origin languages distributed in relation to household income that might tell us something?

To learn more about the data we have been working with and Canada's language data, in general, below are some links to resources to explore further.
