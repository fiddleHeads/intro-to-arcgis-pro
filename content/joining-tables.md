# Joining Tables
Joining data using a common attribute is an important and useful function in GIS. There are two ways of joinng data in a GIS, joining via an attribute from a table or joining data spatially. You can also relate data from one table to another in order to understand how they are related. Rather than appending data from one table into another, a relate allows you to interact with the data between the two tables. Find out more about joins and relates in the [ArcGIS Pro documentation](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/tables/joins-and-relates.htm).
