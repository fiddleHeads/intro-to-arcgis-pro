## EXPORTING AND SAVING
***Add some content about this is what you do once you want to export your map as an image***
### Layout Mode
1. On the Insert Tab > Project Toolbar, click New Layout.
2. In the resulting window, select Letter Landscape.  

_Note that a new Layout ‘window’ tab has opened next to the Map tab. You can switch back and forth._

### The Map Frame
Note that the Layout Toolbar (Insert Tab) is now active and that many of the tools on this toolbar look similar to those on the Tools Toolbar, with one very important difference.  Now that you are in Layout Mode, your need to add a Map Frame to a piece of paper.

1.	On the Insert Tab > Map Frames Toolbar, click Map Frame.
2.	In the resulting window, select Default, but notice the Europe and Asia Bookmark is there.   

### Layout Navigation
Using the Layout Tab that now activates, take a moment to explore the Layout Toolbar.
Notice how the Navigate options behavior differ from the Navigate on Map Mode.

#### Resizing the Data Frame
Because the map is not the same proportions as the page, the border is larger than the frame; we will want to alter the size of the Map Frame (not the Page Size) to the size we desire for our final image.

1. Click on the Map Frame and notice that a Map Frame Format tab activates
2.	Click on the Size and Position Toolbar and set the Frame Size as Width to 8.3 inches and the Height to 5 inches.
3.	Press Align Center and Align Middle, to center the map on the page. (If not active, make sure the Align to Page is checked)
4.	On the Frame Tab, go to Current Selection and change the Map Frame to Border
5.	Change the border weight to 4 points.  
6.	Assign a Gap of 10 pts for both the X and Y tabs.
7.	On the Layout Toolbar, go to Bookmarks and select your Europe & Asia bookmark
8.	Click on the Activate Tool (Layout Tab >Map Toolbars) or   right-click  on the map itself and select “Activate”
Now you can move the map around, pan and zoom in and out until you get the map the way you want to see it.
9.	Go back to the  Layout Tab, under Activated Map Frame  and select Close Activation
10.	Then, at the top of the page, under the Map Frame set, go to Layout. Now the Navigation tools show a different set of options and if you zoom, you’ll zoom in and out of the page itself.


#### Adding Map Elements

### Map Legend
1.	Go to Insert>Legend and click on the Map Layout
2.	On Contents, list the Map Elements by Drawing
3.	Expand the Legend, and select Major_Cities and drag it to the top.
4.	With the Legend selected, on the Format Set, go to Format Tab,
5.	Change the Current Selection from Legend to Border and add a Border.
6.	Repeat the same procedure to set a Background (white is a good choice).
7.	Return to the Map Tab
8.	Click once on the Major_Cities Layer, wait a few seconds, and then click again to highlight the Layer Name for Editing.  Rename the Layer “Major Cities” removing the underscore, and hit the Enter key to commit the change.
_Note that the change you have made to the name of the Layer is also reflected in the Legend (Layout)._
9.	Make changes to the other Text Elements of your Layers so that your Legend contains properly formatted and reasonable text descriptions and labels.

### Scale Bar
1.	Go back to the Layout View and go to to Insert>Scale Bar
2.	On the Scale Bar Format > Symbol, Select Scale Line 1
3.	Go to the Design Tab and set the Number of Divisions to 1 and the Subdivisions to 1.
4.	Set the Division Units to Miles.
5.	Click on the Numbers and Marks Tab.
6.	Set the Number Frequencies to “Divisions”
7.	Use the Handles to resize and reposition the Scale Bar.

### Export Your Map
1.	Save your Work.
2.	On the Share Tab, go to the Export Tool and click the Layout button…
3.	Browse to the Intro to ArcGIS Pro folder and save the file as: World_Population
4.	Change the Save as type to PNG(*.png)
5.	Change the Resolution to 200 dpi
6.	Click Export.
7.	Browse to the Workshop Folder and double click on the EX01_World.png file to view it in the default image viewer.
